# Clever Todo
*A todo app with a custom keyboard*

Clever Todo is a simple todo application built with Vanilla JavaScript that experiments with a custom keyboard for task entry.  
Unlike most todo apps, it is designed to preserve task history, so work is never truly lost.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to explore better ways of entering and managing tasks by:

- Making task input more engaging with a custom keyboard
- Preserving the full history of tasks (created, edited, completed, and deleted)

## Why This Project?

Most todo apps feel like typing into a spreadsheet, and deleted tasks disappear forever.

This project aims to:

1. Make task entry more enjoyable and efficient  
2. Ensure that no task history is lost  

## Why Vanilla JavaScript?

This project is built using plain JavaScript to focus on mastering core web fundamentals—such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management—before moving on to frameworks.

The emphasis is on understanding how things work under the hood rather than relying on abstractions.
